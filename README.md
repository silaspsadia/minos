# minOS

minOS (Mini-OS) is a lightweight 32-bit x86 operating system used for my personal reference:
  - Segmentation (IDT/GDT support)
  - Interrupt handling (ISRS/IRQ interfaces)
  - Keyboard/Timer drivers
  - Full stack memory interfaces (pmem manager, vmem manager, pager, heap_acquire)
  - Preemptive multitasking
  - Context switching
  - Basic interrupt handling
